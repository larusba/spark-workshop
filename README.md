# Apache Spark Workshop

This is the repository for the Apache Spark Workshop.

## How to run

Be sure to have Docker installed and run

```
docker-compose up
```

It will take some time so be sure to run this before the Workshop take place.

Note that **this is not definitive version**. This repository is getting constantly updated and we highly suggest you to pull the new version the day of the workshop!

If you have any problem please open an issue on this repository.
